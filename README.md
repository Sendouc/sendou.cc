# My personal website

This is something I made to have all my links in one place. It is a static website built with Next.JS and Tailwind CSS.

# Getting started

1. `git clone` to clone the repo
2. `npm i` to install dependencies.
3. `npm run dev` to run in development mode.
4. `npm run build` to build.
