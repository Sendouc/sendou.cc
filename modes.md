What modes to play in competitive Splatoon has always been under debate. 

There are some clear merits when it comes to playing Splat Zones (SZ) only. The biggest of those is simply that it's the easiest ranked mode. Quite a few of teams playing in the scrims or tournaments are just pickups that are thrown together. They don't haven't honed any specific strategies but rather rely on individual skill and general game knowledge to succeed. This levels the playing field as teams that have more experience playing together don't have as big advantage as in the other modes.

SZ only is also an easy focus to make. With that I mean take for example MakoMart. I'm pretty sure I have played MakoMart SZ many times over MakoMart Tower Control (TC), Rainmaker (RM) and Clam Blitz (CB) combined. This ties to the so called 92 map problem where the amount of map and mode combinations to learn in this game is huge. So if we decide we are going to play just SZ that cuts it down to a much more manageable 23. This is on top of it being the easiest ranked mode like I mentioned earlier.

One pitfall all TC, RM and CB share that I personally don't really enjoy about them are the lull periods where one team is just defending their strong lead. There are some mechanics in the game to prevent one team just stalling. These are things like pushing the tower in TC preventing the enemy gaining static special recharge or Rainmaker resetting. Yet the shift in the game is pretty easy to see once we move on from both teams still looking to make their big push compared to one team just stalling. Of course being able to stall is a privilege they have earned but they are still dull moments in the game for both teams. 

SZ does not have these lull periods. Both teams are always . One sided games end in a swift knockout. Comeback always feels possible as any hold can very well be the last one. This is also distinct from other modes. Think about something like Humpback Pump Track TC. One team can be completely overwhelming and push to 10 in the first minute of the game but still be incentivized to never push again in the whole game.
